# Is "Disable Checkpoints" enabled? (GEODE MOD)

Small Geode-exclusive mod where the only purpose of it is to display a message at the top right corner of the Pause Menu, whenever you have the "Disable Checkpoints" option enabled in platformer mode, nothing else to say

## Developer comments

Here's some extra data that I found while trial an error:

* Audio Visualizer = Game Variable "0144"
* Show Time = Game Variable "0145"
* Disable Checkpoints = Game Variable "0146"
* Show Hitboxes = Game Variable "0166"
